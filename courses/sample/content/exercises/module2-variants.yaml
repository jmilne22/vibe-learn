          hints:

                The SRS system uses these keys to track each variant independently. Every variant gets its own ease

          hints:
            - It maps concept names to anchor links in the lesson.
            - The exercise renderer shows these as "Review this concept" links.

            conceptLinks maps concept names to lesson anchors.

          title: Practice Mode Selection
          description: >-
            A user has 12 exercises due for SRS review and 4 weak exercises. Which daily practice mode should the system
            auto-select, and why?
          hints:
            - >-
              The auto-select logic checks: due >= 5 → review, weak >= 3 → weakest, any remaining → mixed, nothing →
              discover.
            - 12 due exercises is >= 5.
          solution: >-
            Review mode.


            The auto-select logic picks 'review' when there are 5 or more exercises due for SRS review. With 12 due,
            that threshold is met. The user should review what's due before tackling weak spots.
          annotations:
            - type: tip
              label: Mode Priority
              text: >-
                The priority order is: Review → Weakest → Mixed → Discover. This ensures users handle due items first,
                then weak spots, then new material.

          title: SRS Rating Effects
          description: >-
            A user rates an exercise as "Had to peek" three times in a row. Describe what happens to the SRS scheduling
            for that exercise.
          hints:
            - "\"Had to peek\" resets the interval."
            - The ease factor decreases with each poor rating.
            - The exercise will keep appearing frequently.
          solution: >-
            Each "Had to peek" rating:

            1. Resets the review interval to 1 day

            2. Decreases the ease factor (making future intervals shorter)

            3. The exercise will appear in every daily practice session


            After three consecutive poor ratings, the ease factor will be near its minimum (1.3). Even when the user
            eventually gets it right, the intervals will grow slowly due to the low ease factor.
          annotations:
            - type: tip
              label: SM-2 Algorithm
              text: >-
                The ease factor has a minimum of 1.3 to prevent intervals from getting impossibly short. A single "Got
                it" rating starts recovering the ease factor.
