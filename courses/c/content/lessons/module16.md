## Concurrency

### Topics Covered

- POSIX threads (pthreads): creation, joining, detaching
- Mutexes and critical sections
- Condition variables and signaling
- C11 threads and atomics (_Atomic, stdatomic.h)
- Race conditions and data races
- Deadlock prevention strategies
- Thread-safe data structures

---

*Content coming soon.* This module will cover concurrent programming in C using both POSIX threads and C11's portable threading facilities, with emphasis on synchronization primitives and avoiding common concurrency bugs.
