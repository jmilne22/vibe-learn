## Project 1: RPN Calculator

### What You'll Build

A stack-based Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) calculator that reads expressions from stdin and evaluates them. A classic K&R exercise (Chapter 4) that ties together arrays, strings, and pointers.

### Concepts Applied

- Arrays as a stack data structure
- String parsing and tokenization
- Pointer usage for string traversal
- Error handling for malformed input
- Modular function design

### Example

```
$ echo "3 4 + 2 *" | ./rpn
14
$ echo "5 1 2 + 4 * + 3 -" | ./rpn
14
```

*Content coming soon.* This project will guide you through building an RPN calculator step by step, starting with a simple stack implementation and building up to a full expression evaluator with error handling.
