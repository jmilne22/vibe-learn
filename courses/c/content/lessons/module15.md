## Advanced Data Structures

### Topics Covered

- Singly and doubly linked lists
- Stack and queue implementations
- Hash tables with chaining and open addressing
- Binary search trees
- Generic data structures with void pointers
- Memory management patterns for data structures
- Choosing the right data structure

*Content coming soon.* This module will cover implementing classic data structures in C from scratch — using dynamic memory, pointers, and structs to build linked lists, hash tables, and trees that underpin real systems software.
