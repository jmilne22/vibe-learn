## Bitwise Operations

### Topics Covered

- Bitwise AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), NOT (~)
- Left shift (<<) and right shift (>>)
- Bit masks: setting, clearing, toggling, checking bits
- Flag manipulation with bitmasks
- Common bit tricks: power-of-two checks, alignment
- Portable bitwise operations and implementation-defined behavior
- Bit-fields revisited
