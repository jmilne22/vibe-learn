## Pointer Arithmetic & Arrays

### Topics Covered

- Pointer arithmetic: increment, decrement, addition, subtraction
- Array-pointer equivalence (a[i] == *(a + i))
- Iterating with pointers vs indices
- Pointers to arrays vs arrays of pointers
- const correctness with pointers (const int*, int* const, const int* const)
- Passing arrays to functions

*Content coming soon.* This module will explore the deep relationship between pointers and arrays in C, pointer arithmetic rules, and const correctness — building the foundation for the RPN Calculator project.
