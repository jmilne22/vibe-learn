## Functions & Scope

### Topics Covered

- Function declarations (prototypes) and definitions
- Pass-by-value semantics
- Scope rules: block, function, file
- Storage classes: auto, static, extern, register
- Recursive functions
- The call stack and stack frames

*Content coming soon.* This module will cover how functions work in C, including the critical distinction between declarations and definitions, how arguments are passed by value, and how storage classes control variable lifetime and visibility.
