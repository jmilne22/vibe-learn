## Iterators & Closures

> Based on The Rust Programming Language, Chapter 13

### Topics Covered

- Closures capturing environment
- Iterator trait
- Iterator adaptors
- Consuming adaptors
- Performance of iterators vs loops

---

*Content coming soon.* This module will cover closures as anonymous functions that capture their environment, the iterator pattern for processing sequences of elements, and how Rust achieves zero-cost abstractions with these features.
