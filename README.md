# vibe-learn

A self-hosted, static course platform. Fork it, replace the content, build, deploy.

**This is a vibe-coded project.** The entire thing — engine, content, exercises, flashcards, all of it — was generated by AI (Claude) as an experiment. I haven't audited a single line of code. I built it for fun to see how far vibe-coding could go. It seems to work, but don't trust it with anything important.

## What you get

- **Lesson pages** rendered from markdown
- **Interactive exercises** with shuffle-able variants and difficulty levels
- **Flashcards** with flip/rate sessions
- **Spaced repetition (SRS)** scheduling for exercises and flashcards
- **Daily practice** sessions pulling from weak/due items
- **Streak tracking** and analytics
- **10 themes** (gruvbox, solarized, everforest, OLED dark, persona 5, factorio, and more)
- **Data export/import** (all progress stored in localStorage)
- **Offline support** via service worker
- **Zero backend** — pure static site, host anywhere

## Quick start

```bash
git clone <this-repo>
cd vibe-learn
npm install        # installs "marked" (only dependency)
npm run build      # generates dist/
```

Serve `dist/` locally to test:

```bash
cd dist && python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Open `http://localhost:8000`.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. Push to a GitHub repo
2. Go to **Settings > Pages**
3. Set source to **GitHub Actions**
4. Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

```yaml
name: Deploy
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  build-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      pages: write
      id-token: write
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
      - run: npm install && npm run build
      - uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: dist
      - id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

## Making your own course

### 1. Edit `course.json`

This is the manifest. Define your course name, modules, tracks, and projects:

```json
{
  "course": {
    "name": "Your Course",
    "slug": "your-course",
    "description": "What this course covers.",
    "storagePrefix": "your-course"
  },
  "tracks": [
    { "id": 0, "title": "Basics", "modules": [0, 1, 2] }
  ],
  "modules": [
    {
      "id": 0,
      "num": "01",
      "title": "Getting Started",
      "description": "First steps.",
      "file": "module0",
      "hasExercises": false
    }
  ],
  "projects": [],
  "annotationTypes": {}
}
```

- `storagePrefix` namespaces localStorage keys — change it per course so progress doesn't collide
- `hasExercises` controls whether the exercise renderer scripts are loaded
- `file` maps to `content/lessons/<file>.md`

### 2. Write lessons in markdown

Create `content/lessons/module0.md`:

```markdown
## Hello World

Here's how to get started.

### Code example

\`\`\`python
print("hello")
\`\`\`

> **Tip:** This is a callout block.
```

The build converts markdown to HTML and injects it into the page template.

### 3. Add exercises (optional)

Create `content/exercises/module0-variants.json` and set `hasExercises: true` in course.json.

Exercise JSON format:

```json
{
  "conceptLinks": { "Variables": "#lesson-variables" },
  "sharedContent": {},
  "warmups": [
    {
      "id": "w1",
      "title": "Declare a variable",
      "concepts": ["Variables"],
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "variants": [
        {
          "instructions": "Declare an integer variable x with value 5.",
          "starterCode": "// your code here",
          "solution": "x := 5",
          "tests": ["x == 5"]
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "challenges": []
}
```

### 4. Add flashcards (optional)

Edit `content/flashcards/flashcards.json`:

```json
{
  "1": [
    {
      "topic": "Variables",
      "q": "What is a variable?",
      "a": "A named storage location in memory."
    }
  ]
}
```

Keys are module IDs (as strings). Each module gets an array of cards.

### 5. Build and deploy

```bash
npm run build
```

## Themes

The platform ships with 10 themes, all generic (no course-specific content):

| Theme | Style |
|-------|-------|
| Default (dark) | Built into style.css |
| Light | Clean light mode |
| Gruvbox Dark | Warm retro |
| Gruvbox Light | Warm retro light |
| Solarized Dark | Ethan Schoonover's classic |
| Solarized Light | Solarized light variant |
| Everforest Dark | Soft green tones |
| Everforest Light | Soft green light |
| OLED Dark | True black background |
| Persona 5 | Red/black stylized |
| Factorio Dark | Industrial amber |

Users switch themes from a button in the sidebar. Selection persists in localStorage.

## How it works

The build script (`build.js`) does:

1. Reads `course.json` for course structure
2. Generates `course-data.js` (runtime config as `window.CourseConfig`)
3. Converts markdown lessons to HTML, injects into templates
4. Compiles exercise JSON to JS for browser loading
5. Wraps flashcard JSON for browser loading
6. Copies engine JS/CSS/themes/assets to `dist/`
7. Generates a service worker with the full asset list

Everything runs client-side. Progress, streaks, SRS scheduling — all in localStorage. No server, no database, no accounts.

## Disclaimer

This is a fun experiment, not production software. The AI probably introduced bugs, bad patterns, or subtle issues I haven't noticed because I haven't read the code. If you learn something from the course content, great. If you find something broken, that's the vibe-coding experience.
